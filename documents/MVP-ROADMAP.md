# MVP Roadmap

This document outlines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) roadmap for Schedulify, defining the core features needed for initial launch and demonstration.

## MVP Definition

The Schedulify MVP is a social media management platform that allows users to:

1. Create and manage a single account
2. Connect to basic social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram)
3. Create, schedule, and publish posts to connected platforms
4. View publishing status and history

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Authentication & User Management ✅

- Email verification
- Password reset functionality
- OAuth integration (Google, Facebook)
- User profile management

### Phase 2: Social Media Integration ✅
- Facebook account connection
- Facebook page management
- Instagram business account connection
- Secure token storage and management

### Phase 3: Post Management ✅
- Post creation with text content
- Media upload (images, videos)
- Social platform selection
- Post scheduling capabilities
- Immediate publishing option
- Draft post saving

### Phase 4: Auto-Publishing & Status Tracking
- Background job for scheduled posts
- Publishing status updates
- Error handling for failed posts
- Re-attempt logic for temporary failures

## MVP Demo Requirements

For the MVP demonstration, the following scenarios must be functional:

1. **User Onboarding**

   - Edit scheduled post
   - Cancel scheduled post
   - View post status (published, failed, scheduled)

## Technical Implementation Priorities

1. **Backend API Completion**
   - Ensure all required endpoints are functioning
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add validation for all inputs
   - Secure API with authentication

2. **Social Media API Integration**
   - Complete Facebook Graph API integration
   - Ensure proper token refresh mechanisms

## Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful when:

1. Users can complete the entire workflow from registration to post publication
2. Scheduled posts are reliably published at the set time
3. The system handles at least 100 concurrent users without performance issues
4. Platform API changes or downtime are gracefully handled
