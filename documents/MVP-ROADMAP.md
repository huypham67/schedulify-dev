### Phase 3: Post Management ✅
- Post creation with text content
- Media upload (images, videos)
- Social platform selection
- Post scheduling capabilities
- Immediate publishing option
- Draft post saving

### Phase 4: Auto-Publishing & Status Tracking ✅

3. Multi-user team collaboration
4. Content approval workflows
5. Additional social platforms (Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.)

## Timeline

| Phase | Timeframe | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Authentication & User Management | Week 1-2 | Completed |
| Social Media Integration | Week 3-4 | Completed |
| Post Management | Week 5-6 | Completed | 
| Auto-Publishing & Status Tracking | Week 7-8 | Completed |
| Testing & Bug Fixes | Week 9 | In Progress |

## Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful when:

1. Users can complete the entire workflow from registration to post publication
2. Scheduled posts are reliably published at the set time
3. The system handles at least 100 concurrent users without performance issues
4. Platform API changes or downtime are gracefully handled
